## What needs to be included in the submission?

### Code
Your code in a *reconstructable* way, meaning we want to verify that your code is running and your results are reproducible. Please provide a step-by-step guide how to get your code running (including dependencies, software versions, etc.). You can also include that in the technical article (see below).

### Documentation
As in every professional project you have to document your results so others can understand what you did and how they can reproduce it. You can do that in form of a **Markdown** or **PDF** file. It should contain the following information:
* Idea description
* Reproducible step-by-step guide on technical implementation
* Overview of project outcome (what did you achieve?)
* Outlook for future improvement (what would you achieve with more time?)
* Please feel free to include graphs, plots, pictures or tables in your document.

### Demonstration Video
Please create a short demonstration video of your project for us. It can be only a live demonstration of the processing flow or additionally contain some slides and voice overlay - up to you. Length should be 1-3 minutes.

### Feedback (Bonus)
Please provide feedback for us. What did you like about the challenge? What should be improved? What would you do differently next time? This is optional, but can get you additional score.

## How to submit?
You will receive an individual upload link for your team from EESTEC. Please upload the demo video to this link. Your code and article you can either also upload there (as ZIP) or push to a private GitHub repo. If you choose the second approach please invite @ederjc to the private repo.

## When to submit?
Submission needs to happen before **Sunday, 05.05.2024, 23:59 CET**. Submissions after this time cannot be counted.
