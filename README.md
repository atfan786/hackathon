## Hackathon Material
* [Challenge Introduction Slides](./challenge_introduction.pdf)
* [Generative AI Introduction Slides](./infineon_genai_introduction.pdf)

## Running the Example

### Preparation

Please start by installing [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

#### Windows specific
On Windows you will also have to install [Visual Studio build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/?q=build+tools#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) with CMAKE support as shown in the picture:
<img src="./img/windows_installation.png" alt="build tools cmake support selections" height="400"/>

Now you can install the required Python package for working with LLAMA2:
```
pip install llama-cpp-python
```

If you don't have Pandas installed you will also have to install it:
```
pip install pandas
```

Afterwards you can clone this git repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Infineon/hackathon
cd hackathon
cd examples
```

### Run the example

Download the `llama-2-7b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf` LLAMA model (or another one of your choice) e.g. from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF) and type this command to run the example:
```
python llama_example.py
```

### Output
The example takes a random GitHub issue from Infineon's GitHub org and outputs something like:
```
...
------------------------------
Selected issue:
Subject: Question: How to use examples with a particular kit
Request: Trying to use these examples with the Prototyping Kit BT WiFi

Is there some manual configuration that needs to be done on my end or is there a setting that will select the target board?
------------------------------

...
Model output:

Urgency level: 3 (somewhat urgent)
...
```

Of course this is only an example to get one potential workflow running and can still output complete trash - doing it better is your task :)
